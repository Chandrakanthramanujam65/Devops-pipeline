# DevOps Pipeline

## Overview

**DevOps Pipeline** is a project that demonstrates the implementation of a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Docker and Python. This setup ensures that applications are automatically built, tested, and deployed, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity.

## Features

- **Docker Integration**: Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Automated Testing**: Executes unit tests to ensure code quality before deployment.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploys the application upon successful tests.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates scaling applications seamlessly using container orchestration tools.

## Project Structure

- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker image, specifying the environment and dependencies.
- **`app.py`**: Contains the main application code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Python**: Verify Python is installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Chandrakanthramanujam65/Devops-pipeline.git
### Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd Devops-pipeline
### Build the Docker Image:
docker build -t devops-pipeline:latest .
### Run the Docker Container:
docker run -p 5000:5000 devops-pipeline:latest
### Usage
Access the Application: Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to interact with the application.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment
This project is set up to integrate with CI/CD tools to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. By leveraging Docker, the application can be deployed consistently across various environments.
